## Traffic Management Utilizing Drones

Our application will provide alternative routes based on the live footage that is being sent through our drones. City residents will also be able to view live streams from the drones that are traveling around the city. We want to first launch this application and the drones in Seattle. However, if this project is successful in the future, we hope that it will be launched in other cities.
